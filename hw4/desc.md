Completion requirements  

**Due**: Tuesday, October 7, 2025, 11:59 PM  

In this assignment you will use Selenium to extract data from a javascript enabled page.  Select a website that you would personally like to scrape as part of your final project. (You might need to select an additional site with Javascript to include in your project.)

You will be graded on your ability to use the the features of selenium to scrape data from a site you are using. The following represent the expectations to earn a B on this assignment (85%).  You will need to do more to earn an A:

* Use a time.sleep statement to scrape pages ethically and check the robots.txt file to make sure scraping is allowed

* generate at least 100 page loads (driver.get(...) or follow a link by  clicking)

* Use selenium to click at least one element to reveal data or follow a link

* Use at least one XPath selector

* Use at least one CSS selector

* Retrieve at least 5 different pieces of information (attributes) from at least 100 different pages.

* Save the data as a JSON lines file where each line is an item dictionary  

To earn an A, you might:
* Use selenium to wait for a desired element to appear

* Use selenium to scroll to a desired object

* Use selenium to hover over an object

* Use selenium to enter text

* Or, use another feature of selenium that increases the level of difficulty of the assignment.

Submit a ZIP file containing your Python file and JSON LINES file to asulearn.  In comments at the top of the file include the following:
